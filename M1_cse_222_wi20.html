    <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gmporter/classes/wi20/cse222a/">CSE222a, at UCSD</a>.
    It was taught by Prof. George Porter. The course focused on
    reading classical and current papers followed by in class discussions. The
    following are papers that I found interesting. Most of the summaries usually
    consist of four paragraphs:<br>
    1. the introduction, problem its trying to solve, the pain points<br>
    2. the idea, how it solves the problem<br>
    3. their implementation<br>
    4. their results and my thoughts<br>

  <h4><a href="#1.1" onclick="open_visibility('1.1');">
      M1.1 Early Internet, Darpa Internet Protocols</a></h4>
  <div id="1.1">
  <p>
    These papers describe the structure of an early internet. The first paper
    is a description of the components in building a packet switching network.
    The second one, published 14 years later is a description the design goals
    and the protocols developed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Paper 1. A Protocol for Packet Network Incommunication (IEEE 1974)
     [<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/cerf74.pdf">Link</a>]
  </p>
  <p>
    The paper first clearly defines the components of the network viz Hosts,
    networks and gateways. The hosts as the end points which are connected to
    each other. Multiple hosts are connected to internetwork. And internetworks
    are connected via Gateways. Each internetwork can use its own protocol
    for communication. But communication across internetworks needed a common
    protocol. The protocol for internetwork communication is the early IP protocol.
    The authors then describe a protocol over the internetwork protocol to
    transfer data between end points.
  </p>
  <p>
    The protocols described are similar to modern implementations of IP and TCP
    headers. The original vision of the packet switching network remains very
    similar to our current networks. The paper clearly explains their choice for
    a common internetwork protocol, while each network was free to develop protocols
    for communication within the network. Th Gateway simply handled translation
    between the network protocols. This is very clearly the design that we still
    adopt, except that hosts very rarely communicate on bare link local protocol.
    Most communication, even between hosts within a network, is over IP. The authors
    choice to have a common IP protocol implemented by all hosts which we have
    acknowledge today as the narrow waist of the internet. Other differences
    include fragmentation using sequence numbers, which have now moved to TCP,
    while IP implements a blunt form of fragmentation.
  </p>
  
  <img src="imgs/M1_interntwhdr.svg">
  <p>
    The authors describe the transmission control protocol as a means to transmit
    a stream of data, which it breaks into segments. Early TCP used the sequence
    numbers provided by internetwork protocol, and both the protocols worked closely
    to transmit data. Modern IP and TCP have been separated into distinct
    protocols with independent functions. The authors also have a section which
    describes early address format and address assignment which have completely
    changed. The authors also envision a central repository that provides addresses
    for each node within a network, which in  way the current DHCP implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The paper is a description of the network that the authors envisioned, some
    of their decisions have formed the basic of the current internet.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>
    Paper 2. The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols (ACM 1988)
    [<a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/ana/Publications/PubPDFs/The%20design%20philosophy%20of%20the%20DARPA%20internet%20protocols.pdf">Link</a>]
  </p>
  <p>
    The second paper describes the philosophy behind the design of the Internet
    protocols after the protocols had standardised. The paper first describes the
    fundamental goals of the network. Then they describe how these goals influence
    the design.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the foremost goals was for the network to and continue
    working despite loss. This goal was adopted since the network
    was initially a military project that was later released for civil use.
    This made the internet fault tolerant at the expense of performance.
    To achieve this, the state necessary for internet functioning is moved to
    the endpoints. This approach is described as "fate sharing" since both entity
    and the state share the same fate. A consequence of this approach was the
    stateless design of switches and gateways. Also, each end node is responsible
    for maintaining any state necessary for the connection.
    It is interesting that the goal and the chosen approach is applied in current
    network designs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The paper then describes the services supported over IP and the need for a
    protocol that allows the user to use the datagram services offered by IP.
    This created a need for decoupling IP and TCP, and building the
    User Datagram Protocol as the protocol which offers these services. The paper
    then describes the division into layers which offer services independently using
    services offered by lower layers. The classical OSI model is the modern form
    of this idea, with clear abstractions of the functions provided by each layer.

      M1.2 Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in an Extended LAN</a></h4>
  <div id="1.2">
    <p>
      Paper: An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in an Extended LAN (ACM 1985)
      [<a href="https://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/datakom/ht06/slides/sta-perlman.pdf">Link</a>]
    </p>

    <p>
      The author describes a algorithm to build a tree from an extended LAN.
      As networks began to grow, with LANs interconnected using bridges to build
      an extended LAN, manual configuration of the bridges increased the risk
      of loops. Similarly a user without proper knowledge could connect LANs with
      a bridge
      and create a Loop. The proposed algorithm allows the bridges to exchange
      data and  construct a tree without any additional configuration. Secondly
      the algorithm converges in O(mesh diameter) while imposing small memory
      requirements (proportional to the number of LANs the bridge is connected to)
      on each bridge.
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/M1_extended_LAN.svg" style="width:400px">

    <p>
      In the final tree, each LAN has a designated bridge. On receiving data from
      a LAN, a bridge forwards the data to all other LANs on which it is a designated
      bridge. The complete mesh is transformed into a tree by choosing the designated
      bridges. The root of the tree is a designated bridge on all of it's LANs.
      The algorithm chooses a very simple way to choose the root. The bridge with
      the smallest MAC value is chosen as the root. The bridges exchange HELLO
      messages to find the root. Once a root is found, the root sends out
      periodic HELLO messages. These HELLO messages are forwarded on all connected
      LANs. The bridges based on the HELLO messages share information and choose
      the designated bridge on each LAN.
      The algorithm works by each bridge first trying to become the root and then
      trying to become the designated brigde on each of the LANs it is connected to.
    </p>

    <p>
      The paper also describes states maintained by the bridge for each LAN and
      transitions between states to prevent loops due to new bridges being added.
      Also, the HELLO messages timeout letting the bridge detect failures in the
      network. This has been described in detail in the paper and I cannot
      sufficiently describe it in a single paragraph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bridge 1 becomes the leader, dotted links are in backup state. Arrows are
      links in forwarding state, pointing towards non leader bridges.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is always nice to see a simple distributed algorithm which
      solves the problem. What is especially refreshing is the poem she wrote as
      a part of the abstract, which summarises the algorithm succinctly.

    Paper: Network Protocol Folklore (ACM 2019) 
    [<a href="https://ccronline.sigcomm.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/acmdl19-336.pdf">Link</a>]
    </p>

    <p> Radia Perlman, having been working on internet protocols since it's
    inception, shares a history of choices they made and their consequences on
    the modern internet implementation. One line from the abstract which makes
    the paper interesting is: <i>Some decisions have made today’s networks
      unnecessarily complex and less functional. Surprisingly, mechanisms that
      were created out of necessity, to compensate for previous decisions,
      sometimes turn out to be useful for purposes other than the original
      reason they were invented.</i>
    </p>

    <p> Ethernet addresses were designed to be 6 bytes long so that nodes
      connected over ethernet would not need any other address configuration.
      But ethernets never have more than a few thousand nodes attached. Each
      ethernet address is unique and location independent, but are simply used
      for link to link transfer. It is interesting that IPv4, which was designed
      so each node would get a unique address dynamically has a smaller length
      of just 4 Bytes. People even envisioned ethernet as Layer 3 replacement, 
      implementing end to end connections over ethernet due to the uniqueness
      property of the ethernet address.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEC had developed an alternate to IP called IS-IS which adopted CLNP
      (ConnectionLess Network Protocol)
      addressing. CNLP has very large 20 Byte addresses ( larger than 16Byte
      IPv6). Though it did not catch on CNLP supported features that were later
      built into IPv6.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper has a brief overview of the history behind the spanning tree protocol.
      Customers expected nodes in different ethernets to work.
      DEC sold routers which routed based on Layer 3 addresses, but expected
      end nodes to implement Layer 3 to route between different ethernets.
      The author argues that the right solution was for all endpoints to
      put Layer 3 into the stack for such inter ethernet communication. But,
      DEC decided that instead of waiting for endpoints to upgrade, it was easier
      to build a network box which routed based on ethernet addresses, i.e. the
      <i>bridge</i>. Radia Perlman was asked to design an algorithm to break
      ethernet routing loops. The resulting algorithm, the spanning tree algorithm,
      a temporary fix till endpoints upgrade their network stacks is still being
      widely deployed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper compares CLNP and modern IPv6. A few features of CLNP are:
      <ul>
        <li> Autoconfiguration by appending 14 byte network prefix with the
             6 Byte ethernet address to build a complete 20Byte address.</li>
        <li> The network prefix is hierchically assigned based on region.</li>
        <li> Within an area since the prefix is common, nodes can move anywhere
          in the area without changing the address.</li>
        <li> Since CLNP had ethernet address, ethernet header could be dropped
          so CLNP is used for both Layer 2 and 3 routing.<li>
      </ul>
      
      IPv4 addressing was not as scalable as CLNP and does not support movement
      within an area without address reconfiguration (especially helpful with
      Datacenters migrating VMs). IP is a flat address space with ethernet
      providing functionality of a region. One consequence of IP and ethernet being
      completely independent is that we need the ARP protocol to discover the
      endnode's ethernet address. CLNP on the other hand needed each node to
      anounce it's location.
    </p>

    <p>
      The paper then moves to the final section which are surprising outcomes
      of the decisions people took.
      <ul>
        <li> Seperation of IP and Ethernet allowed VLAN, which provides the
          ability to configure which nodes can talk. This is used in datacenters
          to build a LAN for a group of VMs</li>
        <li> Since CLNP uses a unique ethernet address which is then announced
          to everyone, tracking using CLNP would have been easier making it a
          major privacy issue. Instead since IP is ephemeral, tracking though
          possible is less intrusive.</li>
        <li> NATs were built to fix IPv4's inability to scale, not necessary
          for CLNP. But NATs have become a major security feature to obfusicate
          users behind a NAT. Also since users behind a NAT cannot be contacted
          without the user initiating a connection, the users are protected from
          external nodes.</li>
      </ul>
