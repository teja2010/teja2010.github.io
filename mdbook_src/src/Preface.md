# 0. Preface

1. This is a simple collection of some of my notes. Some parts are incomplete, I'll
   mark them with a ​"WIP"​ tag.

2. No license. I am doing this for myself. If you find it helpful, that is great.
3. Please send any feedback/errors to tteja2010 at gmail dot com .
4. I went through the Linux code and then later read/understood OS concepts. My way of looking at OS related topics is hence biased towards Linux, which may make my notes weird/unnatural.
5. I like my notes to be very simple. If I were to forget the past couple of years of my life due to an accident, I should still be able to catch up by  going through my notes (Assuming I discover that I had written these notes) That is how simple it should be. I don't want to assume anything about the reader (my amnesiac self who just completed his bachelors) while writing them.
