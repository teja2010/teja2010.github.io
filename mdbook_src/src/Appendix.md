# A. Appendix

These are a few links I think are useful.

1. David Miller's [How SKBs work](http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/skb.html) and [skb data](http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/skb_data.html). His home page has [other useful links](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fvger.kernel.org%2F~davem%2F%22+html) as well.
2. [lwn.net](https://lwn.net) contains clean summaries. Search for links from site, e.g. lwn pages about [eBPF](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3A%22lwn.net%22+ebpf).
   3. LWN page with Kernel related articles grouped by topic: [Kernel index](https://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/).
4. [lartc.org](lartc.org) the best place for routing, traffic shaping, tunnelling info.
5. Twitter has a lot of active netdev members. [my list](https://twitter.com/tejaswi_tan/lists/netdev1)
