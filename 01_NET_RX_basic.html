  <h3>01 Packet RX path 1 : Basic</h3>
  <a href=index.html>INDEX</a>

  <p>
    This page describes the code flow while receiving a packet. It begins with
    the packet just entering the core networking code, top half and bottom half
    processing, basic flow through the IP and UDP layers and finally enqueueing
    into the socket queue.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally hash based software packet steering across CPUs (RPS and RSS),
    Inter Processor Interrupts (IPI),
    scheduling softirq processing, some parts of the loop back driver code
    and softnet_data struct are described. They can be
    ignored in the first read and can be revisited in later runs after gaining
    additional context. These sections have been marked OPTIONAL.<br>
    NAPI will be described in later pages, all NAPI APIs are ignored now.
