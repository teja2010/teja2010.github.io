  <h3> My Notes. </h3>
  <p>
  This page contains my notes. Mostly related to linux and networking.<br>

  <br>
  I have divided my notes into pages, and sections within each page. Refering to
  section X.Y implies section Y in page X.<br>

  <br>
  Code or commands that need to be run in the shell will be displayed in
  a monospace font. The paragraph preceeding it will contain the necessary
  explanations.

  Note:<br>
  1. Forgive my simple html page, I find simple html pages comforting. The html
     source is clean and readable aswell.<br>
  2. No license. I am doing this for myself. If you find it helpful, that is
     great.<br>
  3. Please send any feedback/errors to tteja2010 at gmail dot com .<br>
  4. I went through the linux code and then later read/understood OS concepts.
     My way of looking at OS related topics is hence biased towards linux, which
     may make my notes weird/unnatural.<br>
  5. I like my notes to be very simple. If I were to forget the past couple of
     years of my life due to an accident, I should still be able to catch up by
     going through my notes (Assuming I discover that I had written these notes)
     That is how simple it should be. I dont want to assume anything about the
     reader (my amenesiac self who just completed his bachelors) while writing
     them.<br>
